# Rush-hour-game
This project was developed in my 2nd semester at FAST. It applies key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism to build a fully functional game. The project demonstrates practical implementation of core OOP principles in C++ while focusing on clean design and reusability.
